# RoboRally-Public
RoboRally was a university project of 6 students. It's a client application for a multiplayer board game.

Instead of using some existing rendering framework like Unity, I provided my own 3D game/rendering engine (using [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/)).

### This repository does not contain the complete project!
The project itself is not open-source, so only the engine (**core**-folder) as well as its usage in the application (**engine**-folder) are provided as source code in this repository.
